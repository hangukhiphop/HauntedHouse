This is the entire codebase for the XNA project Haunted House, created for ITP 380 - Video Game Programming.

The XNA solution files are not included, so the game cannot be run.

My primary work was on the following files:

Camera.cs 
The spring camera following Boo

GameState.cs
Player movement and collision mechanics

The rest of the credit goes to Sanjay Madhav, who provided the starter code, Sean Sharma and Austin Spiegel.
